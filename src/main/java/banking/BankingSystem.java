/**
 * Description - Step 3 :
 * It's very upsetting when the data about registered users disappears after the program is completed.
 * To avoid this problem, we need to create a database where you will store
 * all the necessary information about the created credit cards.
 * We will use SQLite to create the database.
 *
 * In this stage, create a database with a table titled <card> with the following columns:
 * id INTEGER
 * number TEXT
 * pin TEXT
 * balance INTEGER DEFAULT 0
 *
 * PS: The database file should be created when the program starts, if it hasnâ€™t yet been created.
 * And all created cards should be stored in the database from now.
